# Batch vs. streaming data processing

## The difference

Data often are not clean at first. We need processing to change its raw form to a consumable one. Batch and streaming are two core data processing methods.

In **batch processing**, data are formed in groups that are processed after a period of data accumulation. On the other hand, **streaming processing** is done when new data arrive.

Batch processing resembles gathering and counting votes during an election: first votes are accumulated, then they are counted. However, an example of streaming processing is the *real-time* collection and analysis of data on interactions between gamers.

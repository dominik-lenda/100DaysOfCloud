# RAW NOTES FROM THIS DAY

### Analytics
- Azure HDInsight  
Supports open-source bigdata frameowkrs such as Hadoop. Spark, etc.

- Azure Databricks  
a more user-friendly

- Azure Synapse Analytics  
more integration, combines data warehouse func with
Apache Spark support

### AI (machine learning)  
learning; training the model to make a prediction

- Azure Cognitive Services  
a collection of ready-to-use AI tools; you can add it
to applications without extensive knowledge of AI;
five categories: decision, language, speech, vision, web search;

- Azure Bot Service

- Azure Machine Learning Studio  
build, train ML models without coding  

- Azure Machine Learning Services  
fine-grained control; etc. train models 
using Azure Databricks, deploy with Azure Kubernetes Service; the best solution if you want to build your own custom AI app;

### Integration
- Azure Logic Apps and Azure Event Grid  
can create complex workflows using many 3-party apps;

### Designing a Solution
Azure Architecture Center has many examples
This time the example of e-commerce app
Seriously, it is so cheap!

### Managing Services
**What are the differences between Azure Machine Learning Studio and Azure Cognitive Services?**

**Learn more about managing services**
What is Azure Service Health, informs about problems with Azure platofrm itself and upcoming maaintananc events
resource hygiene  - how secure resources are based on Azure security best pratices

I Building a solution II Maintaining a solution securly is a different story

- Azure Monitor  
a collection of monitoring apps: Application Insights - monitoring a state of app, Log Analytics - lets run complex queries, Metrics and Alerts - statistics of CPU, etc, send an alert if one statistics is too high

- Azure Backup  
Good to have backups in case of problems;
Azure Backup is linked with VMs; so it looks like IaaS thing; many Azure services has its own backup utilities;
even on-premise can use it (sounds quite complex thing to do)

- Azure Advisor  
It helps to find valuable information about a state of resources or helps to keep security issues in tact; high-level app. It provides security recommendations.

- Azure Security Center  
More information about security than Azure Advisor. Gives security recommendations. It uses other services such as Azure Advanced Threat Protection, Azure Policy.

- ARM Template  
a templates to easily reproduce given solution; create and manage resources automatically; you can specify configuration.

- Azure Blueprints
Automate deployment of all Azure enviroments, so it automates collections of ARM templates and other stuff like policy and user permissions.

### Summary 
Azure is a collection of online services that organizations can use to build, host, and deliver applications and it runs it on Microsoft's data centers all around the world.

- Compute  
Virtual Machines, Azure App Service, Azure Kubernetes Service, Azure Functions
- Storage  
Raw storage: Azure Blob Storage, Azure File Storage, Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2  
Relational DBs: Azure SQL Database, Azure DB for MySQL, Azure DB for MariaDB, Azure DB for PostgreSQL  
NoSQL DBs: Azure CosmosDB, Azure Cache for Redis  
- Networking  
VNet, VNet Peering, Azure VPN, Azur ExpressRoute   
- Migration  
Azure Migrate, Azure Active Directory  
- DevOps
Azure DevOps, Azure DevTest Labs, Azure CDN  
- IoT  
Azure IoT, Azure IoT Hub, Azure Sphere    
- Analytics  
Azure Databrics, Azure Synapse Analytics
- AI 
Azure Cognitive Services, Azure Bot Service, Azure Machine Learning Studio, Azure Machine Learning Services    
- Integration  
Azure Logic Apps  
- Management  
Azure Monitor, Azure Security Center, ARM Templates, Azure Blueprints

Ways to access Azure:
- Azure Portal, CLI, PowerShell, SDK, mobile app.

Billing_Account(Subscriptions(Resource_Groups(Resources)))

Regions contain multiple data centers, regions that has availability zones may spread VMs across availability zone.

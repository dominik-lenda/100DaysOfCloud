# Introduction to the Cloud 

## Introduction

I'm choosing this subject because I want to build strong foundations of cloud-related knowledge.
## Prerequisite

It is good to know more or less what servers and datacenter are.

## Cloud Research - Introduction to the cloud (raw notes)
### What is Cloud Computing?
The cloud is rapidly developing technology. 
It helps companies to operate on a huge scale.  

Cloud Computing is a remote virtual pool of on-demand
shared resources offering Compute, Storage, Database, and
Network services that can be rapidly deployed at scale.

The word **SCALE** is crucial here. 

Cloud is based on a on-premise technology. So it solves
problems that are related to on-premise. It maximizes the power of cloud computing.

What is **Virtualization**?
You can have multiple virtual machines, each running a separate OS and applications using 1 physical server!
This is huge.

**Sharing hardware resources** is a key here.

A **hypervisor**, which is a piece of software, allows to create multiple VMs to be installed on the same physical server.

Any request to the hardware goes via the Hypervisor. 

Benefits of Virtualization:
- less hardware is required (reduced capital expenditure)
- less space, power, cooling required within datacenter (reduced operating costs)
so **optimization of resources** 

**Virtualization** has been used in on-premise datacenters for a long time.

What are resources?
- Compute 
- Storage 
- Database
- Network

* Compute
Compute objects are like 'brains' to process workloads.
CPUs, RAM, related to hardware

* Storage
resource that allows me to save and store the data
- typical env -> hard disk

* Database
What are databases?
not much info
engines SQL, MySQL

* Network resource
connectivity between resources having some function
e.g. routers to route traffic, fire walls to allow or deny traffic

'Cloud Computing' is a remote virtual pool of on-demand
shared resources offering Compute, Storage, Database, and Network services that can be rapidly deployed at scale.

### Cloud Deployment Models

- Public Cloud
- Private Cloud
- Hybrid Cloud

**Public Cloud**
A vendor gives access to the infrastructure
It can be provisioned on demand
exact location is not known to a consumer but the region is known.

The cloud vendor gives all the bacend and physical maintenance such as power, cooling, hardware failures.

You can access a public cloud from anywhere you just need an internet connection.

**Private Cloud**
Infrastructure is privately hosted and managed.
More direct control, security.
The hardware is on-premise.

But is different from the typical *on-premise server farm*
Still Virtualization, sharing compute, storage, network
Virtualization will create a pool of shared compute. storage and network resouces.

More capital expenditure is required
opex also increases
Capital expenditure?
CapEX; investments on start
OpEX; running costs

**Hybrid Cloud**
Public and Private Cloud
for seasonal high-load traffic or Disaster Recovery
it is a link between private and public cloud

hybrid is often short-term config for test and dev

public/private/hybrid vs. security/data location/capital expediture/operational expedinture/tenancy

Key Cloud Concepts
- On-demand resourcing - immediate provisioning

- Scalability - scaling up; scaling down; 'in and out'
use more computing power or less; num

up/down - more computing resources per virtual machine
in/out - add or remove the number of VMs

great advantage in comparison to in-promise

- economy of scale 
low resource costs compared to traditional hosting

- flexibility and elacticity
you choose the amount of resources you requires, how much; how long; what scale
custimization

- growth 
organization with the benefits off cloud can grow easily

- utility based metering
pay for what you use

- shared infrastructure
multiple organizations/users - tenants can be running VMs on the same hardware

less physical hardware; cheaper you know

- highly available
?? do not understand the slide

- security
AWS and Azure considered to be more secure
shared responsibility model

### Cloud Service Models
IaaS; PaaS; SaaS
different level of managibility and customization

- Software as a Service (SaaS)
the least customizable
widley distributed and  accessed Gmail

- Platform as a Service (PaaS) 
greater level of control

access to a framework; but underlying architecutre; physical hardware, network component, and OS are typically managed by the vendor

- Infrastructure as a service (IaaS)
the greates level of customization and control

you configure your own resources, VMs, virtual networks; OS etc.

vendor controls hardware
other:
DRaaS, CaaS, etc.

### Common use cases of Cloud Computing
- Migration from on-premise to public cloud

- Traffic Bursting
using to cloud to manage traffic in hard seasons

- Backup/Disaster Recovery
unlimited storage space

- Web Hosting
load balancers are good, traffic deloading; scaling
CDN is amazing; cashing locally

- Test/Dev Env
use servers for test and dev when u need

- Proof of Concept
prepared sucessful solutions? 

- Big Data/Data Manipulation
huge datasets; data lakes; good way to manage them

### Mapping data center architecture to the cloud alternative
i'd like to run my own small data center and pet it like a puppy;
- location; 1 office; cloud many places
- physical security 
public cloud vendor's responsibility is to make it secure; you need less
- mechanical and electrical infrastructure
cooling; air conditionin; fire supression; etc.
- network infrastructure
switching, routers; firewalls
cloud has easily to set up networks
- servers 
they are virtual machines
- storage
unlimited, scalable; great
storage area network
